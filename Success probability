# Given parameters
n <- [Your number of trials here]  # Replace with your number of trials
p <- [Your probability of success]  # Replace with your probability of success
k <- [Desired number of successes]  # Replace with your desired number of successes

# Compute the probability using the dbinom() function
prob_k_successes <- dbinom(k, n, p)

# Print the result
print(prob_k_successes)
